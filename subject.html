  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noragami">Noragami</a> is an anime and manga written by Adachitoka. It began in 2010, and the manga currently has 22 volumes. There are also 25 anime episodes produced by studio bones and licensed by Funimation in North America. The manga is licensed in English by Kodansha USA. I chose to write about this because it is one of my favorite series and I enjoy talking about it.
