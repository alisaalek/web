  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noragami">Noragami</a> is an anime and manga written by Adachitoka. It began in 2010, and the manga currently has 22 volumes. There are also 25 anime episodes produced by Studio Bones and licensed by Funimation in North America. The manga is licensed in English by Kodansha USA. I chose to write about this because it is one of my favorite series and I enjoy talking about it.

  <h2>What is it about?</h2>

    The main character of Noragami is a 15 year old girl called Iki Hiyori. One day, she runs into Yato, a small god with no shrine and almost no followers. She saves him from a car crash (not knowing that he is a god) and becomes tied to him and the far shore where spirits reside. She becomes a half-spirit (or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayakashi_%28y%C5%8Dkai%29"> ayakashi </a>) and asks Yato to fix her body so that she can be normal again. Yato agrees but can not fix it right away, so Hiyori keeps getting caught up in his problems. The basic premise of the story is that there are phantoms and there are people, and living beings cannot see the phantoms but the phantoms can influence them to do bad deeds. It is the god's jobs to get rid of the phantoms and fulfill the prayers of the people. When people die, their soul can become corrupted and turn into a phantom, or they can turn into a shinki, a divine weapon for the gods.

    The main character, as stated above, is Iki Hiyori. The other two main characters are Yato and Yukine. Yato is the small god that promised to help Hiyori, and Yukine is his shinki. Other characters include Ebisu Kofuku, the goddess of poverty and a friend of Yato's, and her shinki Daikoku; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vai%C5%9Brava%E1%B9%87a"> Bishamon </a>, a major god of war that has a grudge against Yato (who is actually a real god in Chinese Buddhism), and Kazuma, her shinki that is in dept of Yato; Tenjin, the god of knowledge and a minor character, and Nora, a shinki that has many masters and is considered disloyal and hated. Nora also has a past with Yato.
