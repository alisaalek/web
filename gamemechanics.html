  OMORI is a roleplaying game, which means that it has dialogue, characters, and a battle system. The basic gameplay is exploring new areas, interacting with objects and people, collecting items, and fighting enemies that wander in certain places in the game's world. There are also several animated cutscenes that trigger at certain parts of the story. For most of the game, Hero, Kel, and Aubrey follow you, and you can make them the party leader and use specific skills that only they have. Mari and Basil are not playable characters because of the plot (see story page). In battle, Omori, Kel, Aubrey, and Hero all take turns attacking. There is a leveling and xp system, and as characters level up they gain new moves that they can use to fight. Only four moves can be equipped at any one time. There are also HP and Juice bars. If HP reaches 0, the character will die and become TOAST, and can be revived using special items. If Juice reaches 0, a character will not be able to use its special moves (as they all have a specific Juice cost.) Juice and HP can be replenished with items or skills. There is also a unique mechanic in the game in which both the enemies and your characters have <a href="https://omori.fandom.com/wiki/EMOTIONS">emotions</a>. There are three types of emotions: sad, happy, and angry, and they give you certain stat changes; for example, if sad, your defense is higher but your attack is lower. There are three "tiers" to emotions; if a character is already sad and a skill that makes him more sad is used, he will become depressed. Interestingly, only enemies and Omori can achieve the third tier of emotion; the other characters stay at the second tier.

    The story mechanics of OMORI are arguably more important than the actual RPG elements. The game is split into four parts: The prologue, Three days left, Two days left, and One day left. The days are referring to how long Sunny has until he moves away from his childhood home (see story). Each of these sections is made up of some gameplay in the real world and some gameplay in Sunny's dreamscape. Certain events are triggered and new areas are revealed to you as each day passes. However, you can revisit most areas on other days. There are also two different routes and four (technically six, but two of the endings are almost identical) endings. They depend on the choices you make throughout the game. Starting on Three days left, Kel will come to your house and knock on the front door. You can choose to go out with him or to stay inside. Choosing to go out will set you on the path of the true route, and staying inside will make you take the hikikomori route. There are several major differences in gameplay between the two routes. The true route has much more content in th real world with your real friends, and the hikikomori route has more content and an extra area in the dream world. Also, you can only achieve the good and "true" ending if you take the true route. The endings will be described in more detail in story.
