    Sunny and Mari were always very close. They grew up together and Mari took care of him and pushed him to try new things. Sunny was always rather quiet and shy, but he was a good listener. One day, Mari and Sunny met Aubrey, Kel, and Hero, and they all became friends. Aubrey then introduced Basil to the friendgroup. They hung after school and then all summer, going to the beach and the park and hanging out at each other's houses. Mari liked to play the piano and Hero cooked for all of them. When Sunny turned 12, everyone pooled their money together and bought him a violin so that he could play duets with Mari. Basil got film and a photo album for his birthday, which made him start taking pictures of the friends and their every day activities. Hero and Mari grew really close and it was obvious that they liked each other. Everyone decided to build a treehouse in Sunn't backyard, and after several months it was done. They brought in toys and made it their hangout. Sunny and Mari continued to practice their instruments, and they managed to get a duet. However, Mari was putting a lot of pressure on herself, and Sunny felt that he could never catch up. The day of the recital, Sunny got angry and threw his violin down the stairs of his house, breaking it. Mari saw and became very angry. She started screaming at him and he tried to leave but she stood in front of him and blocked his way. Overcome by his emotions, Sunny pushed her down the stairs. He watched her fall and stared in horror as she lay completely still on the floor and her head began to bleed. He called her name over and over and grabbed her hand but she wouldn't respond. He picked her up and dragged her towards the bed, thinking that perhaps she just needed to rest, but she was unresponsive. He kneeled beside her crying as Basil walked up to him. Basil saw what had happened and he tried to comfort Sunny. He was scared that his best friend would be arrested, that the authorities would not understand that it was an accident and that Sunny would be taken away from him... so he had an idea. He dragged Mari's body to the backyard and tied a noose using a jumprope. He hung the noose onto a tree and then put Mari there to make it look like a suicide. The whole time Sunny was staring at one blank spot and dissociating, pretending that none of this was happening. However, when the kids were walking back into the house, they both turned around and saw Mari's eye glaring at them through her bedraggled hair. It scarred both of them and became Something, a "monster" that haunted their dreams. When everyone came home for the recital, they found Mari dead. The friends all drifted apart after that and no one except for Basil and Sunny knew the truth. </p>
  <p>
    Sunny became a recluse and created a dream world for himself. In this world, Mari was alive and all of his friends were still kids. They were going on fun adventures and spending time together, and none of the events of the real world had happened. In this world, Sunny was Omori, a silent version of himself created to protect himself from the memories of the trauma. He locked the truth of the accident deep inside himself, in an area called Black Space. Above it he created his dream world, the Headspace, and also White Space, an endless expanse of white with a door to the dreamscape that served as a way to repress Sunny's memories.</p>

    Four years have passed, and Sunny is moving away from town into a new home. In his dream world, Basil goes missing because of his association with the accident, and everyone goes to serach for him. At the same time, Kel decides to reach out to Sunny and spend his last days in town together. This is where the story diverges into two paths, as I had mentioned previously. If you go along the true route, Sunny will meet all of hid friends again and spend the last day in town recalling memories and having fun with them. Everyone stays over at Basil's house on the last day because Basil's grandmother is sick and they want to support him. That night, Basil has a mental breakdown and hides in the bathroom. You have the option to save him or to choose not to. If you choose not to save him, Something (the memories of the accident) will overcome him and he will kill himself. Sunny goes home and has two options. If he grabs the knife before he goes to bed, he stabs himself in his sleep and you get the first neutral ending. If Sunny does not take the knife he wakes up and drives away form the town with Something following him. He is still haunted by guilt and is never able to get peace or reconcile with his friends. If you choose to save Basil, he will attack Sunny in the bathroom. Basil believes that it was not Sunny that pushed Mari, but something behind him, and he attacks the boy in an attempt to kill that thing. Sunny beats Basil up, and then Basil picks up a pair of scissors and Sunny gets stabbed in the eye. He passes out and appears in his dream world. In his dream world, he gets back his memories of the truth of the accident, and he has to fight Omori, the embodiment of his guilt and hatred and suffering. Omori eventually beats you, and you have the option to give up or keep going. If you choose to keep going, Sunny takes his violin and plays a final duet with Mari. Omori ceases to exist, and Sunny wakes up in the hospital and heads to his friends and Basil. There he decides to tell them the truth in the first words he's spoken in the entire game. The end credits show him driving away in a car as a bittersweet song plays. There is also an extra scene after the credits where Sunny smiles at Basil and his Something disappears, and Basil smiles back and his monster recedes as well. This is the good and true ending; Sunny and Basil are able to come to terms with what happened and move on with their life. They find a new future for themselves and tell their friends the truth, even if it makes them leave. They finally confront their feelings, and although they have done a horrible thing, they are still able to find some peace. This is my favorite ending. IF you choose to not continue, Omori wins and Sunny ceases to exist. Omori wakes up inside Sunny's body, and instead going to his friends, he walks to the roof and jumps off of it. He kills Sunny so that he can be in his dream world forever. </p>
  <p>
    In the hikikomori route, the two endings are the same as the endings where you choose to not save Basil, except Basil does not die (at least, you aren't aware of it.) Sunny either stabs himself in his sleep or drives away with Something following him, his friends still in pain and isolated, and nothing resolved. </p>
  <p>In essence, I believe that this is a story about hope. I hope you can see why I love it so much. It is a very emotional and touching story, and it is especially relatable to people with mental illnesses who may be going through things similar to Sunny. I think that it is very well written and portrays a lot of dark and heavy themes in an effective way. The mix of the bright and colorful world and the gloomy reality make you feel unsettled, and there is always something just a little bit off in Sunny's headspace, showing his fractured mind and guilt. Throughout the story, you get to see photo albums of what the friends did together, and it is so sad to see them having so much fun with Mari. They feel like real friends and real people that you get to know. You can see how many fun memories they had together, and it resonates with many people's real childhood memories. It hurts even more knowing that Mari is dead and that she can never come back, that you never got to experience any real events with her and that all you get to see are images and stories. It creates a real sense of loss that you never got to know this characters. The topics Omori explores are also very dear to a lot of people. Almost everyone has nice childhood memories to look back at and best friends that you lost connection to. That mix of nostalgia with the sense of loss aand abandonment, along with the fear, loneliness, and hopelessness that Sunny feels, make for a story that a lot of people can relate to in different ways. There is a unique meaning to take out of the story for everyone. Personally, this has been the only video game to ever make me cry. Some of the dream world parts can get boring or tedious, but the story and the art style is amazing. I also really enjoyed how you only find out that Sunny is the one that accidentally killed Mari at the end of the game. Over the course of the game, you learn about him and begin to sympathize with and like him. I had never thought that he could be the one in charge of Mari's death, even if it was an accident. When it gets revealed, it feels genuinely shocking and sickening, especially since its about a character you thought you knew well and had begun to care about. The game also brings up a lot of good moral questions. During the final battle with Omori and Sunny, Omori calls Sunny selfish and says that he does not deserve to be alive. He also says things such as "You killed Mari and you loved her." When playing this, I honsetly thought that Omori had a point. Sunny was only a child, and he seemed like a good person, but he had taken a life. Does he deserve to die for that? At the same time, he has suffered so much for four years, and that might be sufficient punishment. Still, is it wrong for him not to serve a jail punishment? And is Basil worse than Sunny, or better? Considering all of these questions makes the game interesting for me. I realize I have written way too much because I am simply in love with this game. I hope anyone who's reading this found it interesting and might give the game a try.</p>
