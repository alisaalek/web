    This is a website about the RPG Maker video game OMORI. It is a psychological horror game created by OMOCAT and co-published by PLAYISM, and it was fully released for PC on December 25, 2020. You can buy it on steam for 20$ <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1150690/OMORI/">here<a>. The game centers around a boy called Omori and his friends Aubrey, Hero, Basil, Mari, and Kel that he explores a colorful dreamscape with. It has been in progress for around six years, and is based on other stories OMOCAT previously wrote and drew. OMORI explores the meaning of friendship and the relationships people make with each other, as well as mental illness, guilt, and self hatred. It is a deeply moving story that I strongly recommend to play or watch a playthrough of, although sensitive topics that are not for everyone such as death and suicide are discussed. The rest of this website has major spoilers for the game. Enjoy!
