 The main character of Noragami is a 15 year old girl called Iki Hiyori. One day, she runs into Yato, a small god with no shrine and almost no followers. She saves him from a car crash (not knowing that he is a god) and becomes tied to him and the far shore where spirits reside. She becomes a half-spirit (or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayakashi_%28y%C5%8Dkai%29">ayakashi</a>) and asks Yato to fix her body so that she can be normal again. Yato agrees but can not fix it right away, so Hiyori keeps getting caught up in his problems. The basic premise of the story is that there are phantoms and there are people, and living beings cannot see the phantoms but the phantoms can influence them to do bad deeds. It is the god's jobs to get rid of the phantoms and fulfill the prayers of the people. When people die, their soul can become corrupted and turn into a phantom, or they can turn into a shinki, a divine weapon for the gods.
